# analyses_friends_annotations
# Friends annotations analysis project for brainhack school 2025:

## Background
This project is based on the friends annotations dataset, which contains half-episodes that are annotated.
The goal of these annotations are to give context about the visual stimuli (FRIENDS half-episodes) that were shown
to participants in a fmri. 
## Main goal
The main goal of this brainhack project is to do basic statistical analyses to the friends annotations data and to present
the results in the form of visualisations.

## Main analyses 
Plot different relations between scenes, segments, duration, frames, number of local maximas and more!

## Data used
Theses analyses are made on the friends annotations dataset, it is available as a submodule in this repo.

This dataset contains annotations made for season one to six for the number of scene cuts, number of local maxima (saliency), segments
annotations and the transcript.
## End product
The end product will be a website containing a description of the project and the plots.

## Tools
The tools I will use are 
Jupyter notebooks to organize my analysis and create some interactive plots.
python,
git and github to version control and share my analyses
mystmd to create my website to promote this dataset and present it in a neat way

## Python libraries
Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy.

## Deliverables
Notebooks on github, website
